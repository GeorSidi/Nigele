A SpringBoot application for the University course of Software Engineering (UOI) in collaboration with Nick Taflampas.

The main purpose of this project is the creation of a user-friendly, web based application with a structured database, that allows an instructor to manage the grading of the courses he teaches. Our application was aimed to be easy to use with a simple yet easy on the eye interface.
